Research Experience
======
**Purdue University, Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences** (Aug. 2021 - Present), _Advisor: Dr. Daniel R. Chavas | Committee: Dr. Matthew Huber, Dr. Stephanie Olson, Dr. Chanh Kieu_
* Performed data analysis of dropsonde measurements of Hurricane Teddy outflow jet
* Gained firsthand experience working with atmospheric reanalysis datasets and general circulation models such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM)
* Analyzed the climatology and dynamics of West African heat lows in reanalysis datasets, and develop method of extending tropical cyclone potential intensity over land for predicting heat low intensity 
* Developed a framework for comparing the expansion rate of tropical cyclone environments globally and between ocean basins
* Proposed a radiative-convective equilibrium framework for understanding factors controlling TC poleward expansion 
* Exploring the role continents play in setting the expansion rate of TC environments via coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model experiments
* Investigated TC environment distribution in a broad range of paleoclimate periods in both idealized and state-of-the-art climate models
* Analyzed TC environment expansion in the high-resolution PaleoWeather iCESM1.3 experiments ranging from pre-Industrial to the Eocene
* Contributed to development of the python package “tcvpigpiv”, used to calculate the tropical cyclone ventilated Potential Intensity (vPI) from gridded data


**Michigan State University Observatory** (April 2019 - May 2021), _Research Assistant_
* Conducted observations of cataclysmic variable stars, exoplanet transitions, and nova outbursts using the 24-inch reflecting telescope 
* Gained experience analyzing visual astronomy data, including image calibration and photometry
* Submitted data to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) and participated in the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey for exoplanets

I am a PhD candidate in Atmospheric Science at Purdue University's Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. I've been at Purdue since 2021, working with Prof. [Daniel R. Chavas](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~dchavas/?_ga=2.199790830.1131875816.1575998997-455793247.1570629607) as part of the Extreme Weather Laboratory. My research is on the expansion of hurricane environments in warmer climates of Earth's future and past, and how ocean basin setup controls it.

I am broadly interested in how climate change affects extreme events (e.g. hurricanes, extreme precipitation, heat waves) using a broad range of different climate models, from machine learning to coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs. I am particularly interested in modeling Earth's past paleoclimate to better constrain our future weather, and better understand regional variability in risk.
